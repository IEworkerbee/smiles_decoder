# BRACES: Bond and Reconstruction of Atomic Chemical Entities for Simulation
BRACES is a cutting-edge software solution designed to enable the accurate reconstruction of chemical structures from SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) strings. Built for researchers, students, and chemical informatics experts. Current libraries to convert SMILES back into chemical notations struggle with ionic bonds, leaving a large percentage of SMILES data unable to be translated back into its original chemical structure. BRACES seeks to remedy these issues by keeping detailed track of valence electrons and charges for individual atoms. 

# BRACES returns accurate coordinates of each atom in relationship to each other in a chemical structure, as derived from a SMILES input. 

BRACES is an incredibly lightweight solution , involving only Python and like 2 other libraries.
